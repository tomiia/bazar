# Anime download (torrent) scripts (they uses only horriblesubs releases).

1) haruhidl uses horriblesubs releases via [haruhichan.com](https://haruhichan.com). It's used like that "haruhidl quality(720p/1080p) url(ex: http://haruhichan.com/page/anime/1483/download-flying-witch.html)" folder(ex: "Flying Witch")

2) nyaa/nyaa2 use horriblesubs release via [nyaa.se](https://nyaa.se). It's used like that "nyaa/nyaa2 quality(720p/1080p) anime name(ex: "Flying Witch").

nyaa let you choose what to downloads (ex: ep 1 to 5, only ep 5, or all for all episodes) and nyaa2 downloads all episodes directly. There is also a -s argument for anime search (ex: nyaa/nyaa2 -s 720p "Flying Witch")

# Don't forget to modify the directory variable dir= for those scripts.
